Planned using Agile and SCRUM


- Items to collect/objects to make

- click

the gini/princess jasmin/lamps only one gini and one jasmin a game - many lamps 
generate a certain amount of these objects per a time frame

SET cursor: to an image of choice;

SET cursor speed

click event on images
--> push to array
--> get length of array and return to screen as score  x3 (for number of wishes per lamp)

- mouseover 

Jaffar will appear as someone to avoid - if mouseover - will get a life taken off
- he pops up randomly too

- game time frame: will run infinitely?

will run for 20 seconds

- score keeper

input for name

points system 



-------HTML--------

links to CSS and JS
what will contain elements?

a score counter
- an inline element/div
- image of a cartoon heart
- counter next to it

classes:
- lamps

ids:
- gini
- jasmin
- jaffar

how to structure?

nav tag - game name - score counter

could have divs of each lamp style as visibility:hidden then change 

p tag for instructions


need to be clickable
- series of buttons

<input type="button" value="lamp" class="lamp"></input>

<input type="button" value="gini" class="gini"></input>

<input type="button" value="jasmin" class="jasmin"></input>

<input type="button" value="jaffar" class="jaffar"></input>



-------CSS---------

images
responsive design
positioning of elements - make fixed and then change with responsive design

potentially how to style instructions - so that they disappear when game begins

p {
    display: block;
    -webkit-margin-before: 1em;
    -webkit-margin-after: 1em;
    -webkit-margin-start: 0px;
    -webkit-margin-end: 0px;
}

-------JS--------

event listeners
- click
-mouseover - mouseout

------------------------Variations on a theme----------------------------
OR jason and the argonauts - golden fleeces and cyclops from monsters inc

OR homer and donuts animation of eating on click

OR sinbad and sailors - recruiting sailors - avoiding sirens

OR popeye and spinach - avoiding other guy

OR block removing - character falls down into a hole - quickest time - blocks are being generated all the time - how to check when they reach the bottom of page though?

OR Shah of Blah and have to collect the words

I am going to make a game about Aladdin and his magic carpet.
There will be a backdrop of an arabian desert - hopefully taken from the Sega Game itself.

The magic carpet will move with the mouse - in fact the cursor will itself BE a magic carpet - on which is sat Aladdin.

Items will appear in random positions on the screen which Aladdin can collect OR as a bonus in design avoid.
