******Why you did it?*****

I completed this project as part of a series of work undertaken throughout the GA WDI course.

I wanted to recreate a shoot-em-up using my nascent programming ability in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Whilst the game was originally inspired by prior flirtations with Disney's Aladdin on the Sega-Mega Drive, graphic resources were unpermitting.

The game is now inspired by a potent mix; the work of the cornish artist Danny Fox, time spent on a cattle ranch in Australia, arcade classic shoot-em ups and internet sensation Rick Astley. 

*********The**Game********
9 are wanted DEAD or ALIVE.

Rick Astley has the highest bounty on his head - weighing in at 10 points. 

While Billy the Kid is getting on a bit now, he moves a bit slower, the price is still high - 6 points for Billy. 

The rest are a ragtag bunch, petty cattle theives and liquor store robbers - some say they're a gang but it seems there's no back bone to any of 'em. 3 points for any of this bunch riding in red.

*******Tech you used?******

---Optional-Player-Numbers----

Either play alone or with a friend 
--> this is loner exclusionist


---------ElDiablo------

Both Rick Astley and Billy the Kid are supposed to move between generated and old coordinates within a third of a second.

(currently only the dastardly Rick Astley moves at such speeds and old Billy is going at a light hobble in his older years)

If you hit the pair then the combined speed of animation is 666.

Thus el diablo is summoned - he clears the board but takes 2 double clicks to defeat and moves at the speed of two thirds of a second. 

------Loading--Screens---

Better backgrounds - with both more spinners and whizzers

Cursor of a spinning chamber for 3 seconds between shots

---Images-Loading-To-Page-By-Random------

Have images moving but wanted them twinkling

-----A-way-of-measuring-the-distance-the-mouse-travelled-----

I wanted to make a game about a villager in a developing nation that has poor access to water.

The further the player is away from the water source and the longer they have been away from their point of origin(the village), the slower the cursor would move to simulate the increasing efforts required. 







Planned using Agile and SCRUM
